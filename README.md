# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering

Dataset provided has historical data about customers and purchase such as age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something we have assigned to each customer based on certain purchase related parameters (not part of this dataset).

Problem Statement: Find out Clusters or Groups of patterns among the customers so that targetted campaigns can be run to promote marchandise.

Solution Approach: K-Means Clustering Algorithm on the Data to find Clusters of customers with similar patterns.

Steps followed:

1. Plot pairwise relationships between features in a dataset
2. Distribution of the features
3. Feature Encoding
4. Build our K-Means Model iteratively between different k values and capture the Silhoutte Score and Inertia (Sum of Squared Distances)
5. Elbow Method to find Optimum k
6. Silhoutte Method for optimum k
7. Assign the Cluster Labels to the Data
8. Visualization of the Clusters in a 3D scatter plot
9. Analysis of Each Cluster
